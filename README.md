# Data-Stream-Management-System

This project complements my phd research: Multilevel Streaming Management System. The demo is developed based on Stanford Streaming project. My major work include:

1. Add security label and access control in streaming system
2. Add computation sharing between queries in different levels

More details can be found in my [PhD thesis](http://discovery.library.colostate.edu/Record/DigiTool246397)
Or you can send me email to request it.
